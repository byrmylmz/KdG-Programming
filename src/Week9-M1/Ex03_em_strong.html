<h1>Nexus 5</h1>

<p>
    The Nexus 5 (2015) will be unveiled on Tuesday, September 29 according to a report from <b>CNET</b>.
    <b>CNET</b>b> does not provide a source for this information, but recent, unrelated speculation also suggested this date.
    <b>CNET</b> also adds weight to the rumors that two devices will be revealed at this launch;
    the smaller Nexus made by LG and the larger version by Huawei.
</p>

<p>
    This news might have inadvertently revealed the release date for <b>Android Marshmallow too</b>. Google usually drops its
    latest Nexus devices at the same time as the latest version of Android, as it did last year with the Nexus 6 and
    Android 5.0 Lollipop. Will we see this trend continue in 2015? It won't be long until we find out.
