			<h2>Shorter lifespan of faster-growing trees will add to climate crisis</h2>

				Rise in carbon capture as global warming speeds growth of forests would be negated by earlier deaths, say
				scientists
			</p>

				Live fast, die young is a truism often applied to rock stars but could just as easily describe trees,
				according to new research.
				Trees that grow rapidly have a shorter lifespan, which could spell bad news for tackling the climate crisis.
			</p>
			<p>
				Trees grow faster in warmer conditions,
				and this should act as a natural brake on global heating,
				as they take up and store more carbon dioxide from the air as they grow.
				But a new study casts doubt on this beneficial cycle, finding that the faster trees grow, the sooner they die â€“
				and therefore stop storing carbon.
			</p>
			<p>Some fast-growing trees, including conifer species in cold regions, have long been known to show shorter
				lifespans, but what was not known was the impact of warmer conditions that can spur growth as global heating
				accelerates. An international team of researchers, publishing their work on Tuesday in the peer-review journal
				Nature Communications, has found that the relationship between faster growth and shorter lifespan appears to
				hold good across tree species and latitudes.</p>
